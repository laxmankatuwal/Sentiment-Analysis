# Sentiment Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment.  

## Features  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization).  
- Machine learning-based sentiment classification.  
- Support for lexicon-based sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob).  
- Visualization of sentiment trends.  
- API endpoint for real-time sentiment analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- Flask/FastAPI (for API)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
